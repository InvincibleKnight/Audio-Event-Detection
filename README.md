# Acoustic Event Detection

## Introduction: 

- The given problem is an audio classification problem, technically know as **Acoustic Event Detection**  
- Each audio file corresponds to an event class, e.g., children-playing, dog-barking, drilling, etc. The folder "audio_train_1ch/" contains the mono audio files (1761 wav files) and the file "labels_train.csv" contains the class labels.

## Task 1

Given an audio file corresponds to a single event, find out that event.  

## Task 2 
 Given an audio file contains a sequence of events occurring one after the other, find out that sequence of events. A sequence can contain at least 1 and at most 5 events.
